I'll loosely describe what I did and you might be able to do the same kind of thing
put your entire assignment inside of a loop, and loop it a lot
write "import random" as the first line of code before this loop we're adding
wherever you took input from a user, instead take a random value:
random.randint(start, end, skip) will give you a random integer from the start to the end, you don't really need the skip
random.choice(list) will give you a random element of the list. use this to keep values consistent (a random integer from range 0-2000 would give you too many scenarios to get past the "years must be entered in order" you can use a list to manipulate the liklihood of the values you get)
random.uniform(start, end, skip) will give you a random float, just like the integer. round it your prefered number of decimal places to simplify your data
after taking every input, print the input
then run it and look through each case to see if each case makes sense
